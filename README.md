# ASL Translator


## 📄 Abstract

The ASL Translator is a project aimed at creating an accessible communication device. Using ultrasonic sensors, it converts hand gestures into text messages that can be sent between two Arduinos via serial communication and displayed on an LCD screen. This system offers a keyboard-free input method, enhancing usability for individuals with limited mobility.
